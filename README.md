#Gaussian Processes

A collection of *MATLAB* scripts accompanied by a brief 
paper which outlines the uses for Gaussian Processes for regression. This
is a weaved document so it consists of *MATLAB* and tex woven into the same
file. I have provided a .m file for convenience, but it is really just a 
symbolic link to the tex file. 

## Running the Code and Generating the Doc
In order to run the code and build the pdf, you need to have *MATLAB* and tex
installed on your system. 

- Run hw3.m in MATLAB
- Run pdflatex on hw3.tex

Alternatively, you can run the build.sh script. Unfortunately I did not make
this script cross platform (only works on OS X).
